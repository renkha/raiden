# Raiden Framework

## Introduction
Raiden is a cutting-edge framework designed for seamless integration with Supabase, focusing on enhancing security, streamlining backend processes, and providing consistent schema management. It specifically addresses the need to avoid direct client-side calls to the database, ensuring more secure and efficient data handling.

## Key Objectives
- Enhanced Security: Prevent direct client-side database calls to bolster security.
- Unified Backend Management: Introduce a unified layer for managing Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), Edge Functions, and standard APIs, simplifying backend complexity.
- Consistent Schema Management: Provide tools for consistent and efficient management and persistence of database schemas.

## Features
- Secure Database Interaction: Ensures secure communication between client and database, mitigating risks associated with direct database access.
- Unified Backend Layer: Streamlines the creation and management of RPCs, Edge Functions, and APIs, offering a centralized way to handle backend logic.
- Schema Consistency: Tools to manage database schemas with ease, ensuring consistency across different stages of development.
